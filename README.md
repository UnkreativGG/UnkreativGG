I have no real idea how github works
i just hope, that i can work at my projects when im not home, not worrying about an usb-stick

My discord is: unkreativgg

<!---
UnkreativGG/UnkreativGG is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
